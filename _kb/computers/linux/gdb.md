## Frontends

In addition to the standard command-line interface, there are some front-ends:

- `gdb -tui` launches a [TUI
  mode](https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/TUI-Commands.html).
- [`gdbgui`](https://github.com/cs01/gdbgui/) runs a GUI in a web interface
- [`gdb-frontend`](https://github.com/rohanrhu/gdb-frontend) also runs a GUI in
  a web interface

There's a comparison of a few on
