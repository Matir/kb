Fontconfig.  Run `fc-list` to see the fonts available.

## Favored Fonts ##

Just some fonts I like to use.

* [Anton
  Regular](https://github.com/google/fonts/blob/master/ofl/anton/Anton-Regular.ttf)
  is a narrow font with a bold feel to it.  Great for words visible at a
  distance (signs, posters, etc.)
* [Bungee](https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/master/ofl/bungee) is a font I
  came to like after it was selected as one of the DEF CON 26 theme fonts.
* [Montserrat](https://github.com/JulietaUla/Montserrat/tree/master/fonts/ttf)
  is a very clean sans-serif font with evenly weighted proportions.
* [Oswald](https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/master/ofl/oswald)
  is similar to Anton Regular, but with more distinct letters.
