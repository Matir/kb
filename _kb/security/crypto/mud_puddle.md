title: Mud Puddle Test
---

1. First, drop your device(s) in a mud puddle.
2. Next, slip in said puddle and crack yourself on the head. When you regain
   consciousness you’ll be perfectly fine, but won’t for the life of you be able
   to recall your device passwords or keys.
3. Now try to get your cloud data back.

Did you succeed? If so, you’re screwed. Or to be a bit less dramatic, I should
say: your cloud provider has access to your ‘encrypted’ data, as does the
government if they want it, as does any rogue employee who knows their way
around your provider’s internal policy checks.
