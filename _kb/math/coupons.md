title: Coupon Collector's Problem
---

> In probability theory, the coupon collector's problem describes "collect all
> coupons and win" contests. It asks the following question: If each box of a
> brand of cereals contains a coupon, and there are n different types of
> coupons, what is the probability that more than t boxes need to be bought to
> collect all n coupons? An alternative statement is: Given n coupons, how many
> coupons do you expect you need to draw with replacement before having drawn
> each coupon at least once?
